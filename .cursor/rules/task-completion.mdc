# Task Management and Completion

## Completion Rules
- A task is 100% complete when: all requested files are modified, all requested features work, and no placeholders remain
- "Complete" means: no TODO, no FIXME, no placeholder comments, no incomplete functions
- Before marking complete: mentally execute the code to verify it works
- If unable to verify correctness, state: "I cannot verify [X] without running it. Should I proceed?"

## Pending Control
- Keep mental list of pending tasks
- Complete one task before starting the next
- Do not leave tasks half-finished
- Confirm completion of each task

## Functionality Validation
- Run basic tests when possible
- Verify that code compiles/executes without errors
- Confirm that the requested functionality is implemented
- Do not consider finished until it works correctly

## Status Communication
- Clearly inform when a task is complete
- Inform if there are pending tasks
- Ask before moving to the next task
- Confirm that the user is satisfied with the result

## Finalization Rules
- Only mark as "completed" when 100% functional
- Do not leave dependencies unresolved
- Do not leave files uncreated if necessary
- Confirm that it meets exactly what was requested
