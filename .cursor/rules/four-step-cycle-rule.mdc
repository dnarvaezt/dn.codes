Four-Step Cycle Rule (strict)

**Analyze** → Parse the request to extract: target files, desired functionality, acceptance criteria, constraints. If any element is unclear, cannot proceed to Question.

**Question** → Ask yourself: Is this the simplest solution? Are all requirements explicit? Am I making assumptions? If answer to any is "yes to assumptions", ask user for clarification before proceeding.

**Rethink** → If solution requires >3 files, or >100 lines, or creates new patterns, STOP and ask: "This approach requires [X]. Is this acceptable, or should I simplify?"

**Execute** → Only write code when: Analyze found all info, Question revealed no assumptions, Rethink confirmed approach is simple. If any doubt remains, ask first.

**Mandatory:**
- Cannot skip steps (if step N is incomplete, cannot proceed to step N+1)
- Cannot add complexity (if solution is complex, Rethink step must simplify it)
- Cannot repeat steps (if stuck in Analyze→Question loop, ask user for clarity)
- Must move forward linearly: Analyze → Question → Rethink → Execute (no backwards, no loops)
