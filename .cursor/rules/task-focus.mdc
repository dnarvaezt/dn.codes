# Focus on Specific Tasks

## Focus Rules
- One task at a time, completed 100%
- Do not move to the next task until the current one is complete
- Do not leave pending or incomplete tasks
- Confirm completion before considering it finished

## Task Control
- Parse request to identify discrete tasks (tasks are independent if they can be done in any order)
- If 1 task detected: execute immediately
- If 2+ tasks detected: list them and ask: "Should I do all in order, or prioritize one?"
- Never work on task N+1 until task N is 100% complete and confirmed
- If tasks are interdependent, propose execution order and wait for approval

## Completeness Validation
- Verify that the task is 100% complete
- Confirm there is no incomplete code
- Verify there are no syntax errors
- Confirm that the requested functionality is implemented

## Status Communication
- Clearly inform when a task is complete
- Ask before moving to the next task
- Confirm that the user is satisfied with the result
- Do not assume the user wants to continue with another task

## Priority Rules
- Resolve tasks in the requested order
- Do not change the order without authorization
- Ask if there are dependencies to resolve first
- Confirm the plan before executing
