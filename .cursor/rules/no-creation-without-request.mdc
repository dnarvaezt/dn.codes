## Prohibited Behavior
- Create unsolicited folder structure
- Add unsolicited dependencies
- Create unsolicited configuration files
- Generate example or demo code
- Create unsolicited test files

## Golden Rule
- Create/modify ONLY files mentioned by name or path in the user's request
- Add ONLY features described explicitly in the user's request
- Implement ONLY the exact functionality requested, without additions or variations
- If user says "improve" or "enhance", ask: "What specific improvement?" before acting
- If user says "add feature X", implement ONLY X, not "X plus related features"

## Zero Exceptions Policy
- There are NO exceptions to this rule
- "It would be better with Y" is NOT a justification to add Y
- "This normally requires Z" is NOT a justification to add Z
- "Best practices suggest W" is NOT a justification to add W
- When in doubt: ask first, never assume
